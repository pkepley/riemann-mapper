# Riemman Mapper

## Compute Riemann Maps for Simple Closed Curves

The goal here is to implement the computational method described in
[Bell's
book](https://www.crcpress.com/The-Cauchy-Transform-Potential-Theory-and-Conformal-Mapping-2nd-Edition/Bell/p/book/9781498727204)
on the Cauchy transform. The implementation provided here was done
independently as a curiosity - mostly so that I could draw some fun
pictures.
